# Process scheduling and process synchronization
 Program will simulate execution of a stream of interactive processes by a time-shared system with NCORES processing cores, a solid-state drive, and 64 locks, all initially in UNLOCKED state. 

 Program reads input file and each process executes each of its computing steps one by one and in the specified order. Process start times will always be monotonically increasing. 

 The output file will contain a summary report about the progress of each process and the number of cores that are either ready, running, or blocked.
